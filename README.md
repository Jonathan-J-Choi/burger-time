## General Info

This application is intended for the hungriest of the hungry who wish to keep track of what kind of burgers they have eaten!
Unfortunately I was not able to complete this assignment.
I was not able to make the burgers logged into the database appear via handlebars.
My most sincere apologies.

## Instructions

In order to use the application, be sure to install all of the dependencies (see below). If the user would like to test in development, they must first start the server connection via Node, and then run http://localhost8080. Be sure to copy and paste our schema file into MySQL Workbench! From there, the user will type into the text field what kind of burger they want to eat!
